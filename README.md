# Trivia-Game

Overview:

In this assignment, I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I chose the "Advanced Assignment" as shown below.

Instructions:

- Create a GitHub repo called TriviaGame, then clone the repo to your computer.
- Create a file inside of the TriviaGame folder called index.html. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
- Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.
- Create a folder inside of the TriviaGame folder called assets.
- Inside assets, create three folders: css, javascript, images
- In your css folder, create a style.css file.
- In your javascript folder, create an app.js file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
- In your images folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.

Choose a game to build from your options below:

Option One: Basic Quiz (Timed Form)
- You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).
- The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
- The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
- Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
- Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)
- You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
- If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.
- The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
- If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
- If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
- On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
